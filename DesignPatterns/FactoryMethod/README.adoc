== Factory Method pattern

[quote, Refactoring Guru, https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method]
____
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
____

=== Idea
Factory Method outsources the creation of an Object from the Constructor into a method. This way the instantiation of an Object can be delegated into specific functions that can reflect the intendet use of the instantiated object via the functionname and its parameters. This way, behaviour of the factory method can also be changed at runtime to return a Singleton or a `null`.

=== Example
In the example code all the animals are internal classes with internal constructors (i.e see `Bear.cs`). This prohibits the instantiation of Objects outside the assemblies scope. From the outside, they can only be instantiated via a `Factory` (i.e. see `BearFactory.cs`) as it offers a `public` create method to get an object implementing the `IAnimal` interface. 



== Abstract Factory pattern
[quote, Refactoring Guru, https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method]
____
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
____
=== Idea
An abstract factory takes the concept of factory method up a notch by supplying an _abstract base class_ for the implementation of factories of familiar objects. A multitude of _classes_ inheriting from the same base or implementing a comming interface can each have their _concrete_ implementation of the abstract factory returning specific instances of the base class.

=== Example
In the example code, the `AnimalFactory` qualifies for the abstract base class. It offers an abstract/overridable method `public IAnimal Create()` to return instances of `IAnimal` interface. Each of the `Bear`, `Lion` and `Monkey` classes implement the `IAnimal` interface. In addition, each one has its own implementation of the AnimalFactory, `BearFactory`, `LionFactory`, `MonkeyFactory` to create instances of objects.
